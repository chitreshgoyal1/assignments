# Split array in three equal sum subarrays
Also print all subarrays

    Consider an array A of n integers. 
    Determine if array A can be split into three consecutive parts such that sum of each part is equal. 
    If yes then print any index pair(i, j) such that sum(arr[0..i]) = sum(arr[i+1..j]) = sum(arr[j+1..n-1]), 
    otherwise print -1. 
    
    Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 4, 0, 4}
    
    console
      ruby run.rb
